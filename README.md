# Search Photo API
## Description 
In this web application, I aimed to create a search engine where, users can type a word or words to search for an image. The photo that the user searched is then uploaded to the web page. I have used an API from unsplash.com to enable the search functionality. 

By default, the app shows three images. However, when a user for example types "dog", the images of dogs is populated on the screen. The user can then do whatever they want with the photos. 

I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Unsplash API. I have also heavily commented the code so that any new beginners or even experienced programmers can understand the code.

I worked on this application to understand API and JavaScript better.
